#### Rust Dependencies:
Ensure your `Cargo.toml` file includes the following dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
macroquad = "0.4.13"  # Game engine for rendering and input
rand = "0.8.5"        # Random number generation
rhythms = "0.1.0"     # Core rhythm handling library
rodio = "0.19.0"      # Audio playback
aubio = "0.2.1"       # Audio analysis for beat detection
biquad = "0.4.2"      # Audio filtering
rayon = "1.10.0"      # Parallelism for performance
